# Points
* Initialization done uniformly in -1 to 1
* Layers are numbered from 0 i.e. first hidden layer is layer 1

# Todo
- [x] Control size of name field
- [x] Impl loss function
- [x] Remove memleaks from step_train
- [x] Batch gradient descent: fix loss decrement and check backprop
- [x] Normalize
- [ ] Get MNIST data
- [ ] Profile
- [ ] See thrust tutorial and parallelize stuff
- [ ] Calcuate loss and accuracy on every train
